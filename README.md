# FlutterStarterProject
Creating a starting Flutter project which has Routing and Responsive layout boiler code already setted up so that the Flutter Devs can get a head-start on building the core components of their awesome Flutter apps and don't waste their time in setting up the boiler plate code for Routing, Responsiveness of their flutter apps.

I have added a couple of dependencies like 

1. Stacked - For quick and easy state mangement.
2. GetIt - For clean and easy dependency management.
